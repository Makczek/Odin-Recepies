                <li class="steps">Step</li>
                <p>Put mashed and cold potatoes to a bowl. Add some cream, salt, pepper and stir it with a pork in order to form a solid mass. 
                To make your filling totally smooth use a blender. Chop the onion, fry it and add to the mass. Mix everything.</p>
                <li class="steps">Step</li>
                <p>Pour the flour into a bowl. Add some salt and very slowly pour water. Mix it with a spoon. Pour some oil and add an yolk. 
                After some time, when water is not so hot you can touch it, knead the dough by hand. Sprinkle a pastry board with flour, 
                put the dough and knead it until it becomes smooth and flexible. The kneaded dough cover with a clean cloth so as not to dry out.</p>
                <li class="steps">Step</li>
                <p>Divide the dough on three parts. Sprinkle your pastry board with flour. One by one, each piece roll out to a thickness of about 2 milimeters. 
                Use the water glass to cut out circles. For each circle put a teaspoon of filling. Amount of filling depends on the size of the wheels. 
                Each dumpling should freely be able to clog, so you musn't pin out the dough too thin and not stuffing can not be applied too amply.
                After the first three dumplings, each cook develop his own system.</p>
                <li class="steps">Step</li>
                <p>Throw your dumplings into salted and boiling water. When they float to the surface, cook for 3-4 minutes. 
                Dumplings serve straight from the boiling water. You can also fry them (already cooked) on butter with oil. 
                Sprinkle your dumpling with chopped and fried onions, everything should be hot, straight from the pot and pans. 
                Sprinkle your dumpling with freshly ground pepper.</p>
