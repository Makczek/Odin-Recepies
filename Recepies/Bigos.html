                <p>Bigos is almost a Polish national dish. This is a traditional recipe from Poland.
            Bigos is a rich flavorful stew with sauerkraut, Polish sausage, beef, pork, red wine, caraway seeds and more.
            The longer it cooks, the better it tastes.</p>
                <p>As a dish that does not spoil quickly and is thought to improve with each reheating, 
            bigos has been traditionally used as a provision for travellers and campers or consumed at 
            outdoor events, such as a hunt or a carnival sleigh ride known in Polish as kulig. It may be also eaten indoor, 
            for breakfast, supper or as a hot starter served before soup at a dinner party. It is commonly found on the menus of milk bars, 
            pubs and bistros throughout Poland. Bigos is particularly associated with major Catholic holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, 
            as it can be prepared in ample quantities beforehand and only reheated on the holiday itself and the following days. The stew is typically 
            dished up with rye bread or boiled potatoes. In a fancier setting, it may be served in stoneware bowls, puff pastry shells or bread bowls. 
            Bigos, especially when enjoyed outdoors, is traditionally paired with shots of chilled vodka, either clear or flavored. Varieties of flavored 
            vodka that match well with bigos include żubrówka (bison grass), jałowcówka (juniper), piołunówka (wormwood), Goldwasser (various herbs) and starka (oak-aged).
            If served at home or in a restaurant, the stew may be paired with beer, red wine or Riesling.</p>

                <li class="steps">Step</li>
                    <p>Place sauerkraut in a large pan or casserole dish and pour in 4 cups of boiling water. Add prunes, allspice, and bay leaves. 
                    Simmer until Sauerkraut is soft, about 50 minutes.</p>
                <li class="steps">Step</li>
                    <p>Pour about 1 cup of boiling water over mushrooms and soak to rehydrate, about 30 minutes. 
                    Drain and chop mushrooms, reserving the liquid.</p>
                <li class="steps">Step</li>
                    <p>Heat oil in a frying pan over medium to high heat. Add onion and sausage. 
                    Saute while stirring until onion is soft and sausage is browned, about 5 minutes.</p>
                <li class="steps">Step</li>
                    <p>In a separate pan, bring about 4 cups of water to a boil. 
                    Add beef, pork, and bacon. Simmer until cooked through for 20 minutes, then drain.</p> 
                <li class="steps">Step</li>
                    <p>When sauerkraut is soft, add the drained meat mixture, sausage-onion mixture, and soaked mushrooms; mix well. 
                    Simmer uncovered over low heat, about 20 minutes.</p> 
                <li class="steps">Step</li>
                    <p>Pour in red wine and cook for 15 minutes until flavors are well blended. Season with caraway seeds, marjoram, salt, and pepper. 
                    Stir in tomato puree. If the stew is too dry, pour in some of the water reserved from soaking the mushrooms, and simmer so flavors combine, about 5 minutes.</p>
