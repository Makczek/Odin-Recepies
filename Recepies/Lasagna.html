        <strong><li>Description</li></strong>
            <p>The lasagna of Naples, lasagne di carnevale, is layered with local sausage, small fried meatballs, hard-boiled eggs, 
            ricotta and mozzarella cheeses, and sauced with a Neapolitan ragù, a meat sauce.</p>
            <p>Lasagne al forno, layered with a thicker ragù and béchamel sauce and corresponding to the most common version of the dish outside Italy, 
            is traditionally associated with the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. Here, and especially in its capital, Bologna, layers of lasagna are 
            traditionally green (the colour is obtained by mixing spinach or other vegetables into the dough) and served with ragù 
            (a thick sauce made from onions, carrots, celery, finely ground pork and beef, butter, and tomatoes), bechamel and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</p>
            <p>In other regions, lasagna can be made with various combinations of ricotta or mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, meats (such as ground beef, pork or chicken), 
            and vegetables (such as spinach, zucchini, olives, mushrooms), and the dish is typically flavoured with wine, garlic, onion, and oregano. 
            In all cases, the lasagne are baked (al forno). Traditionally pasta dough prepared in Southern Italy used semolina and water; in the northern regions, 
            where semolina was not available, flour and eggs were used. In modern Italy, since the only type of wheat allowed for commercially sold pasta is durum wheat, 
            industrial lasagna are made of semolina from durum wheat.[14] Nonetheless, in the north and especially in Emilia-Romagna, the tradition of egg-based dough 
            remains popular for artisanal and homemade productions. </p>

                <li>1 (16 ounce) container sour cream</li>
                <li>2 (12 ounce) packages shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
                <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>½ cup chopped pitted green olives</li>
                <li>3 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            </ul>
        <strong><li>Steps</li></strong>
            <ol>
                <strong><li>Step</li></strong>
                Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
                <strong><li>Step</li></strong>
                Cook sausage, ground beef, and garlic in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, 
                until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain any excess grease. 
                <strong><li>Step</li></strong>
                Stir in diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, parsley, basil, oregano, and sugar. Bring to a boil over high heat, 
                then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 30 minutes.
                <strong><li>Step</li></strong>
                When the sauce has simmered for about 15 minutes, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Add lasagna noodles and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain. 
                <strong><li>Step</li></strong>
                Stir sour cream, 1/2 of the mozzarella, Parmesan, olives, eggs, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. 
                <strong><li>Step</li></strong>
                Assemble the lasagna: Spread a thin layer of meat sauce evenly over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with 1/3 
                of the lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the remaining meat sauce, and 1/3 of the cheese mixture; repeat layers two more times with 
                remaining noodles, sauce, and cheese mixture. Sprinkle remaining mozzarella evenly over top. 
                <strong><li>Step</li></strong>
                Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly and the cheese is golden brown, about 30 minutes.
